# Jira CLI in rust

A cli that group jira and github together in a beatiful workflow ðŸ¦„.

## Usage

1. To install (In the future we'll have releases with pre built binaries)

```sh
cargo install jirarust
```

2. Add the necessary information as environment variable to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`.

```sh
export JIRA_TOKEN="<your personal access token>"
export JIRA_USER="<the email you use on your account>"
export JIRA_URL="<the url of your jira instance>"
export JIRA_CARD_PREFIX="<the prefix of your jira cards (normally depend on your board like TEC-xxx)>"
export JIRA_PROFILE_ID="<The id for your profile>"
```

3. Just run and be happy ðŸŽ‰

```sh
jirarust
```

> Tip: Change the binary name to `jira` or something better for your use.

## Requirements

- [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

## Goals

- [ ] Fix build github action to release pre built binaries for different platforms
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add documentation
- [X] Add commands to view description of a card
- [ ] Add commands to move through other columns like (homol, done, etc)
- [ ] Make transition object less personal(today the number only works for my jira board I think)
